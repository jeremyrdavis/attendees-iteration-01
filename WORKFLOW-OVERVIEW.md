# DDD Hexagonal Workshop Workflow Overview

This document provides a summary of the four iterations in our DDD (Domain-Driven Design) Hexagonal Architecture workshop. Each iteration builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and expanding the application's capabilities.

## Iteration 1: Core Domain Model

**Introduction:**
In this iteration, you'll learn the fundamentals of Domain-Driven Design by implementing the core domain model for conference attendee registration. You'll focus on creating aggregates, value objects, and domain events that capture the essential business rules.

**Steps:**
1. Create the `Attendee` aggregate with basic properties (email, name)
2. Implement the `Address` value object with validation logic
3. Define the `AttendeeRegisteredEvent` domain event
4. Create a domain service for attendee registration
5. Write unit tests for the domain model

**Summary:**
By the end of Iteration 1, you'll have a solid foundation in DDD concepts and a working domain model that encapsulates the core business logic for attendee registration. This model is independent of any infrastructure or framework concerns, focusing purely on the business domain.

## Iteration 2: Hexagonal Architecture

**Introduction:**
This iteration introduces the Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) pattern. You'll learn how to separate the domain model from external concerns by defining clear boundaries and interfaces.

**Steps:**
1. Create ports (interfaces) for repository and event publishing
2. Implement adapters for persistence using a database
3. Add adapters for the REST API endpoints
4. Connect the domain model to the infrastructure through ports
5. Configure dependency injection to wire everything together

**Summary:**
After completing Iteration 2, you'll understand how Hexagonal Architecture enables the separation of concerns, making your application more maintainable and testable. The domain model remains pure while adapters handle the technical details of persistence and communication.

## Iteration 3: Integration with External Systems

**Introduction:**
In this iteration, you'll learn how to integrate with external systems while maintaining the integrity of your domain model. You'll implement an anti-corruption layer to translate between different contexts.

**Steps:**
1. Create a model for the external sales team system
2. Implement a translator between the sales team model and your domain model
3. Add an endpoint to receive data from the sales team
4. Create integration tests for the new functionality
5. Ensure the domain model remains isolated from external influences

**Summary:**
By the end of Iteration 3, you'll understand how to protect your domain model when integrating with external systems. The anti-corruption layer ensures that concepts from other contexts don't leak into your domain, preserving its integrity and clarity.

## Iteration 4: Advanced Domain Modeling

**Introduction:**
The final iteration focuses on advanced domain modeling techniques to handle more complex business requirements. You'll learn about domain events, event sourcing, and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).

**Steps:**
1. Enhance the domain model with additional business rules
2. Implement event sourcing for tracking attendee history
3. Apply CQRS to separate read and write operations
4. Add specialized query models for reporting
5. Implement eventual consistency between read and write models

**Summary:**
After completing Iteration 4, you'll have a sophisticated understanding of advanced DDD techniques for handling complex domains. The application now supports a richer set of business requirements while maintaining a clean architecture and separation of concerns.

## Conclusion

Through these four iterations, you've progressed from a basic domain model to a fully-featured application with a clean architecture that can accommodate complex business rules and integrate with external systems. The DDD and Hexagonal Architecture patterns have provided a solid foundation for building maintainable, testable, and flexible software that closely aligns with business needs.
